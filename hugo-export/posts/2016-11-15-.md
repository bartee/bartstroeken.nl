I work at a large news site. We run our applications on a Python-Django stack, with [Redis][1] for cache and MySQL as a database. Having 55k concurrent visitors during a regular day, we have to be high performant and high available. We use [haproxy][2] to let our applications connect to their datasources and caches, in general.

Yesterday, I was implementing the haproxy setup on our production API application servers for connecting to Redis. Although those machines are provisioned by [Puppet][3], it still involved quite some manual labour. Especially since they needed to have security patches manually &#8211; since we&#8217;re in the process of automating that.

While I was doing that, I monitored redis performance using

<pre>redis-cli monitor</pre>

Then, this happened:

<pre>watch -n 1 'redis-cli CLIENT LIST | awk -F ":" '\'' {print $1} '\''| awk -F "=" '\'' {print $3 } '\'' | sort -i | uniq -c | sort -r'</pre>
