On May 19th, 2016, at 03:30 AM I woke up feeling like a giant log was pushing down hard on my chest. It was the first sign of a path down stress-awareness.

It all made sense: I have a demanding job, with quite a prestigious project at that time. Within two year&#8217;s time we got married, we moved to another city, my precious band ended,Â and we became first time parents. So, whilst we are now parents of the sweetest boy alive, I suddenly have 2 hour commuting time in stead of 30 minutes, I&#8217;m driving myself in stead of going by public transport &#8211; otherwise my commuting time would be doubled, I have no structural outlet hobby time anymore.
