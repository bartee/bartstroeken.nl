My profession: developer.
I&#8217;m a full stack developer, and I had quite a bit on my plate. You can look at <a href="http://menu.bartstroeken.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the menu of my career &#8211; my resume &#8211; here</a>.  Fun fact: it&#8217;s an application I&#8217;ve built to have a go with Tornado, and some other tools. <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bartee/tornson-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use the source to find out more</a>.

You can have a look at my <a title="My Github Profile" href="http://www.github.com/bartee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> or  <a title="My Bitbucket Profile" href="https://bitbucket.org/bartee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitbucket</a> &#8211; profile for some repo&#8217;s. The public ones are mostly POCs, but I also have some interesting projects.

**My passion: musician.
** Singer/guitar player. [Follow this link for more info (dutch only)][1]
