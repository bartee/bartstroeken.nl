I have been singing since before I was able to talk, and I still very much enjoy doing so.
Choirs, bands, musicals, you name it.
I've played Christian in Moulin Rouge, Riff Raff in the Rocky Horror Show and Woof Dashund in Hair.
I've written Ontbijt Voor Twee together with Marc Smits, and that became the anthem for the Algemene Introductie Dagen in Wageningen, where I studied back then. The two of us toured three weeks throughout England and Northern Ireland.

And as De Hollandse Meesters, Christoffel Klimbie and myself graced quite a few parties in and around Amsterdam playing swinging acoustic covers.

As a singer/guitar player I have a heartfelt preference for acoustic work.
It is direct, it also works when the power's out and the only thing limiting you to progress is your own creativity.
For me, it always just works.
I like to reimagine songs in a way they fit me better.
If you hear me play Jason Mraz' I'm Yours or Omarm from the dutch band Bløf, you'll recognise it.
But recognising my renditions of Creep, Sitting on the Dock of the Bay or I wanna Dance With Somebody you'll have to prick up your ears.

## Action!

Here are a few recordings of my work.
With the band De Hollandse Meesters we played the wonderful Achteraf Sessies of Tommy Tin, where they managed to bring  music
to very unpredictable places.
