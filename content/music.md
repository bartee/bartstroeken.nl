## Bio

With a lifelong passion for singing and performance, I've embraced a variety of musical roles—from choirs to musicals, including playing Christian in Moulin Rouge and Riff Raff in The Rocky Horror Show. 
I co-wrote Ontbijt Voor Twee, the anthem for Wageningen’s introduction week, and toured England and Northern Ireland with Marc Smits. As part of De Hollandse Meesters, I also played swinging acoustic covers for years. 
As a singer and acoustic guitarist, I bring a heartfelt, creative approach to my performances, favoring the intimacy of acoustic work. 
Expect reimagined renditions of popular songs like Jason Mraz's I'm Yours, Bløf's Omarm, and classics such as Creep and Sitting on the Dock of the Bay, all infused with my personal 
touch and style.
