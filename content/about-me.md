The most important thing in software development is users.
If you have no users, what are you working for?

To me, that matters in quite a few things.
I'm a Site Reliability Engineer: I help others measure and safeguard user happiness whilst enabling teams to develop value in a reliable way.
That means helping teams and stakeholders in figuring out user value.
That means setting up SLIs, SLOs and error budgets.
That means solidifying setups where needed.
And it circles back to one thing: deliver to your users what really matters, no matter what.

Whatever I'm building, people should want to use it.
Otherwise, theyâ€™ll find a way to work around it.

That's what I want and tend to do. Add a little extra to people's lives.
